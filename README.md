# Threelow
Command-line implementation of a game called Threelow - a simpler version of Yahtzee. Every turn, a player rolls five dice. After each roll, the player must choose to hold at least one die (can choose to hold all five). The round continues until all five dice have been held, with the aim being obtaining as low of a score as possible.

Scoring is relatively straightforward - every face has a point value matching its face value, with the exception of three, which has a point value of 0. The player with lowest score after everyone has had a playthrough is deemed the winner.
